I'm a full stack Software Engineer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I've just begun my journey as a developer having graduated from Prime Digital Academy in the Spring of 2017.  I've been fortunate to have worked at two amazing organizations where my learning skyrocketed with the help of some incredibly talented mentors.  Java, Groovy and Spring Boot-based REST APIs are my current focus, but I've had the pleasure of working on front end projects with Angular and AngularJS as well as DevOps work-flows with AWS, Drone Continuous Delivery and Docker.
